This short snippet can be used to change number poll behavior so the poll is submitted as soon as a number is selected, instead of requiring they also click the 'Submit' button.

Assumptions:
- There is one and only one number poll on the given guide step
- There is a submit button, the ID for which is stored in the submitButtonId variable (you will need to update this in the js code)
