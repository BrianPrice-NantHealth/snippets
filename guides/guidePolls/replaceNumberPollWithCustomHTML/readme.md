## Replace Number Poll with Custom HTML/Text

Some customers want a number-style poll with radio buttons, but want to use their own images or text to definee the buttons.

Whatever is placed in the `translate` JSON can be used to replace the contents of the number buttons. In this example, each number button is filled with an img object, and the JSON is used to store the img source URL. However, it could be used more simply to just swap out the numbers for custom text, like "Agree" and "Disagree".
