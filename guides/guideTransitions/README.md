## Usage

Create a new guide and insert Custom Code building block. In the respective HTML, CSS and JS code blocks, copy and paste code in each section. Once you add the snippet code, you can add your other guide building blocks to complete your guide step. Lastly, duplicate the guide step for every other step to retain the code block with the animation code, then edit the other guide building blocks as you desire.
