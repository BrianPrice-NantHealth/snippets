Description: This is a poll that is designed to get your customers resolution at the time that this guide activates for them. It uses the javascript variables window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth. This will *not* get the screen resolution - Rather it get's the size of the usable window space that is available to your app, so exclude the browser and operating system elements such as the Task Bar and Url Bar.

Set-up: In order to use this javascript you must have 2 text response polls set like the below image. Then, in the code block - add the css and javascript to the appropriate tabs. (Css and javascript)

!!!Disclaimer!!! There are no guarantees that this will function on all browsers - I have tested it on chrome on my device - but I have not tested enough to confidently release into a production environment - If you intend to use this please test it for your environment and your app. If you'd like this code customized or want to know about it contact services@pendo.io
