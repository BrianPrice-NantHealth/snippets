* This customization is designed to work with a bottom-aligned banner guide 
* The collapse action works by simply moving the guide down below the bottom of the screen
* You can use this to move the entire guide container out of the way (make sure the expand button is still visible), or you can leave the guide partially visible and hide the bottom section only
* The collapsed state is saved in sessionStorage so that when users navigate between pages, the guide will stay collapsed or expanded
