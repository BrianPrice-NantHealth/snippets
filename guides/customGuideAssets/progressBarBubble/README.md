# Progress Bar (Bubble Format)
This is a pure html/css progress bar that spans multiple steps.  Numbers are automatically generated based on number of HTML "steps".

## Configuration
Bubbles can be transformed into the "completed" state by adding an "active" class to the respective list element in the HTML file.  When a list element is active:
* Color will change to active color
* Number inside the bubble will convert to a check mark
