# Snooze & Go To Step

This will execute a snooze and a go to step simultaneously on the click of an existing Pendo Guide button.  You can add any kind of button you'd like, as the first lines of this code will strip the existing event listeners.

Video of this in action can be found [here](https://pendo.zoom.us/rec/play/iIYheTspF78Dx3HHEo9p-KkBR8PGX3swaVDkyDlcKGN5MSed3Spbicea_ek2Kl6ryUCLJLIrehjMrALN.1sHwkClQVRwtDVRs?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=tujhBB9DQbSOrHNB-zKwvw.1628787392628.2fba522066afe54adfe02921e1b56905&_x_zm_rhtaid=307).
