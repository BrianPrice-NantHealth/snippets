## Guides
This repository contains custom HTML/CSS/JS snippets that can be used to extend the functionality of Pendo Guides.  All code, unless otherwise stated, should be inserted into a [Custom Code Building Block](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360032206011-More-on-Custom-Code-Block) within a guide in the Pendo Visual Design Studio.  The vast majority of these snippets apply only to the [Visual Design Studio](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/categories/360001404191-Guidance#Visual_Design_Studio), as opposed to the legacy [Classic Designer](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360032206671-In-app-designer-Classic-). 

The sub-directories within this repository are based off of either actions that guides can do (advance a guide, dismiss a guide, delay a guide, etc), or modifications to existing Pendo building blocks or polls (customGuideAssets, guidePolls, etc).  Please avoid the _zz_deprecated_ snippets, as there are better ways, often using newer, in-product Pendo functionality, to achieve the same outcome.
