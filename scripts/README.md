## Scripts
These scripts have been written by the Pendo Professional Services team to achieve certain outcomes.  They can be hosted or used individually at your discretion to interact with Pendo API endpoints “AS IS” without indemnification, support, or warranty of any kind, express or implied.  Please do not reach out to Pendo Support for help with these snippets, as custom code is outside of the remit of their team and responsibilities.

You may require an API key to run these scripts.  API access is a paid feature of the Pendo Platform.

Assistance for writing custom aggregations can be provided in the form of a Professional Services Engagement (services@pendo.io).  These will require a custom services contract in order to complete.
