# Custom On Close Button (with bonus close on loss on click backdrop)

This snippet will help you create a custom close button so you don't have to stick with the defined button on the guides. Also, when you click off of the guide - it will also dismiss. A nice feature add that corresponds with most dialog behavior you find right now.

# Pre-Requisite
* A publicly available image accessible via URL for the close button.

### To Use This Script

* Create a new guide
* On your guide, create a new HTML Code Block
* Copy and paste this code into the *Javascript* tab.
* Replace *<URL_TO_YOUR_CLOSE_BUTTON_IMAGE>* with the URL to your close button image
