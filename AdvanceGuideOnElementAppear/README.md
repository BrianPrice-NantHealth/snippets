# Explanation
This code is designed to make a guide advance when the element that the next guide step is targeted to appears. It checks for the element after a user clicks.

I.e. You have a banner asking a user to open a modal or click a drop down menu - when the menu appears the banner advances and a tooltip pointing to an element in the modal or dropdown appears.
