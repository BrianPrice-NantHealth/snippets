## ZenDesk (or other) Knowledge Base Custom Integration

This is a rebuild the base functionality of the Knowledge Base integration with open code, to allow customizations as necessary for services engagements.

This rebuild does not currently have full feature-parity with the default integration, but it comes close.

It is recommended to adjust the overall resource center height to at least 550 px and increase width to at least 375px for overall ease of reading.
