## Resource Center
This repository contains custom HTML/CSS/JS snippets that can be used specifically to modify functionality of the [Pendo Resource Center](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031866712-Resource-Center-Overview), or its sub-modules (ie, Announcements, Code Sandboxes, etc).  Note that this is different than the legacy [Guides Center](https://support.pendo.io/hc/en-us/articles/360031867272-Guide-Center-Classic-); snippets for the Guides Center can be found in a sub-directory in this repository, but snippets will not work interchangeably between the two products.
